# Scout Core Agent API

Using Scout, but have an app in a language we don't yet support? You're in luck!

If you can send messages over a Unix Domain Socket (hint: you can in every common language), you can add tracing and instrumentation to your app.

This repository contains documentation and examples for the Core Agent API. Note that the Core Agent itself is closed source.

## Quick Start

See the [NodeJS example](https://github.com/scoutapp/core-agent-api/blob/master/examples/nodejs/app.js).
